# first-sdss-jet-accretion-connection
A deeper look at the jet-accretion connection in AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei). Uses Python/astropy to combine archival data from the VLA (Very Large Array) FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters) survey, with optical spectroscopic data from the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey).
